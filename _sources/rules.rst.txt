Aim of the Game
---------------

You control a Challenger - a captured human - sent into the Shifting Maze, 
whose only way of obtaining freedom is to traverse the Maze to the far side, 
pick up a Key and return across the Maze, using the Key to gain their freedom.
The first player to have a Challenger escape the Maze is the winner.

The Shifting Maze is a 10 by 10 (in the X and Y directions) set of Cubes - 
a third Z dimension but the action only takes place on a single level, 
with any Challengers transported to another level in the Z direction effectively lost. 
Different Cubes have different numbers and configurations of Doorways (open sides), 
creating routes through the Maze.

The Maze is continually shifting, with individual Cubes rotating, 
and lines of Cubes moving in the X and Y (and Z) direction. 
The players also have the power to rotate cubes to create new pathways through the maze.

There are also robots released into the Maze to stop the Challengers; 
known as Defenders, they will kill the Challengers, if they get chance. 
The Challengers can stun or destroy the Defenders, 
but this depletes their important power reserves. 
Challengers can also attack each other, should they feel the need.


Starting Set-up
---------------

The maze is randomly generated.

The players start with and their Challenger Counter in their designated 
start area and their Power Point Indicator at 10,

Turn Sequence
-------------

* Defenders Move, in number order (if present), and resolve any Challenger reactions.
* Maze Event
* Challengers Move

Defender Move
-------------

A Defender takes 3 Investigate / Move actions, using the following rules:

* It will move towards the nearest Challenger in line of sight.
  if there are 2 or more equidistant, it will randomly decide which one to move towards.
* It will move through an Open Doorway leading to a known Cube.
  if there are 2 or more, it will:
  * not retrace it's route;
  * randomly decide which Doorway to take.
* If there is a Doorway to an Uninvestigated Cube, then it will investigate, 
  and then start at 1. again.
* If there are only Closed Doorways, it will rotate the current cube clockwise once, 
  and then start at 1. again.

If the Defender moves into a Cube with a Challenger, it will attempt to kill them.

Maze Event
----------

Before the Challenger can take actions, there will be a random Maze Event,
and the resolution of and Challenger Reactions.

This will be on o fthe following:

* Special Action
* Rotate Cube clockwise once
* Rotate Cube clockwise twice
* Rotate Cube clockwise three times 
* Slide X Cube Line along Plus 1 (Cube Line randomly determined)
* Slide X Cube Line along Minus 1 (Cube Line randomly determined)
* Slide Y Cube Line along Plus 1 (Cube Line randomly determined)
* Slide Y Cube Line along Minus 1 (Cube Line randomly determined)
* Slide Z Cube Line along Plus 1 (Cube Line randomly determined)\ :sup:`*`
* Slide Z Cube Line along Minus 1 (Cube Line randomly determined)\ :sup:`*`

:sup:`*` In the base game, this just removes the Cube in question.

Special Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the base game, if there are less than two Defenders in the Maze, 
a new Defender will be added on a cube determined by 2D10 
(this may be an existing Cube or a new one).


Challenger Move
---------------

The Challenger takes actions in any order:

* up to three Investigate / Move / Pick Up Object Actions.
* any number of Power Actions (as long as the Challenger has sufficient Power Points remaining).
* any number of Free Actions.

The challenger can perform three of the Main Actions in any order,
including multiple uses of the same action, and interspersed with Power Actions.

Investigate
^^^^^^^^^^^

Challenger can Investigate any Cube (but not diagonally adjacent) to the Cube 
that they currently occupy, if there is no Cube revealed in this space. 
The player draws a tile from the Tile Bag and places it with the red dot at the 
Low X end (i.e. The end at which the Challengers start).

Move
^^^^

Move the Challenger through an Open Doorway to an adjacent Cube.

Pick Up Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Take an Object Counter from either the Cube that the Challenger is in
or from the Body of another Challenger and place it on your Challenger Board, 
subject to there being a spare slot for it.

Challenger Power Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At any time within the Player Turn, subject to the Challenger having enough Power Points remaining, 
the Challenger may perform any of the actions as many times as desired:

For One Power Point:

* Rotate Current Cube clockwise or anti-clockwise once
* Rotate an Adjacent Cube clockwise or anti-clockwise once,
  if it can be seen though a Doorway in the Current Cube

For Two Power Points:

* Stun a Defender: this renders it out of action for the next Defender Move
  or for it's current Defender Move if this is played as a reaction.
* Stun another Challenger, either in the Current Cube or within line of sight 
  (i.e. through a series of Open Doorways). The other Challenger misses their next turn 
  (signified by placing the Large Cross Token over the Mains Actions Indicator on the 
  Challenger Board of the stunned Challenger).

For Five Power Points:

* Destroy an Adjacent Cube, that you can see
  (i.e. there is a Doorway leading to it from the Current Cube.
  The Cube is removed from the Maze and replaced by a Destroyed Cube Tile.
* Destroy a Defender: this removed the Defender From the Maze.
* Kill another Challenger, either in the Current Cube or within line of sight 
  (i.e. through a series of Open Doorways. The other Challenger Marker is replaced by a Dead Challenger Marker, with any objects that the Challenger was carrying placed on top of it. The Player whose Challenger has been killed, resets their Challenger Board and starts with a fresh Challenger on their next turn.

Challenger Free Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Challenger may perform any number of legal Free Actions on their turn; these include:
 - Discard an Object: the Object Token is removed from the Challenger Board
   and placed on the Current Cube.
 - Use an Object. For example, a Battery Pack may be used to add the number of Power Points 
   left in it to the Challenger (up to the maximum of 10).
   To indicate this, the Battery Pack Token is replaced (on the Challenger Board) 
   by one with the remaining number of Power Points; if it is completely used up, 
   it is removed from the game.

Reactive Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a Challenger is threatened with death at any time (even when it is not their turn)
they may use Main and/or Power Actions to save themselves. They may only spend actions 
until they are safe; after this they must stop. Power Actions are spent in the usual way, 
with the Power Track on the Challenger Board adjusted. Main actions used are recorded
by placing a Small Cross Token over a Main Action Indicator on the Challenger Board 
for each of actions used. These are essentially used in advance against 
the next Move's allocation and will not be available for the next Challenger Move.

The situations the constitute a threat of death are:
- a Defender moving into the Challenger's Current Cube
- the Current Cube moving in the Z direction (i.e. up or down)
- the Current Cube moves in the X or Y direction beyond the edge of the Maze grid (this also implies an up or down movement)

The possible Reactive Actions that might be taken are:
- Stun or Destroy the Defender.
- Move to another Cube.
- Rotate the Current Cube or an Adjacent Cube to create a Doorway that is not Closed.
- Investigate an Adjacent Cube.
